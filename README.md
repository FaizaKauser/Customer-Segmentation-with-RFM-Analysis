# Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Analysis
In this article, we are going to see Recency, Frequency, Monetary value analysis using Python.
Segmentation using K-Means Clustering Algorithm
Suppose that we have a company that deals in various products and we want to divide customers into different segments, like high-value customers, medium value customers or low-value customers, and similarly many others. We have the data that can we analyze, but what kind of analysis that we can do?

Well, we can segment customers based on their buying behaviour on the market.
Keep in mind that the data is really huge, and we can not analyze it by just looking at an overiew of it. Here we will discuss how to cluster customers on segments based on their behaviour using the RFM Analysis in Python.

# Steps of Analysis:
We will perform this analysis in the following steps:

1. Gather the data
2. Prepare the data
3. Cluster the data
4. Interpret the result

# What is RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis?
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. The system assigns each customer numerical scores based on these factors to provide an objective analysis.
# Recency: How recently has the customer made a transaction with us.
# Frequency: How frequent is the customer in ordering/buying some product from us
# Monetary: How much does the customer spend on purchasing products from us

#Rating Customer based upon the RFM score:

rfm score >4.5 : Top Customer

4.5 > rfm score > 4 : High Value Customer

4>rfm score >3 : Medium value customer

3>rfm score>1.6 : Low-value customer

rfm score<1.6 :Lost Customer


# Results:
A pie plot has been displayed for all segments of customers.
